  <h1>WARNING!</h1>
  <p>
      This is a Demo,  Alpha Advantage's API limits are 5 requests per minute on the free API Key. Therefore you may experience some weird behavior, things like graphs not loading in, empty page, missing stock information. Listen, I get it, you want to track your stocks and build your empire but you must understand; If someone else is using this demo at the same time as you, it will not work and you will have to wait a minute and refresh the page. It be like that sometimes... <br> Normally the API key would allow more requests but its mad expensive... Maybe if you hire me I could afford to get the Premium API key so we can both build our empires? Just a suggestion :)<br>
